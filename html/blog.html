                    Properly maintaining your auto parts is key to keeping your car in top condition. It can also
                    help ensure your safety, the safety of your passengers and your fellow drivers. Here are some
                    ways to help keep your car running smoothly.
                </p>
                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Check Your Air Filter</h6>
                <p>Many car problems are due to clogged air filters or loose fittings. The air filter prevents dirt
                    and particles from entering the engine. During combustion your engine needs air, and a clogged
                    filter may impact performance.
                    You should get your filters changed every 12 months or after 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.
                    Don't ignore this maintenance as it could lead to problems in your car engine or car cabin as
                    you also breathe air that is filtered by the internal cabin air filter.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Change Engine Oil and Filter Regularly</h6>
                <p>Many car owners’ manuals today recommend increasing the interval between oil changes. But frequent
                    oil change is still necessary especially if you are maintaining a used car. Frequent oil changes
                    flush abrasive dirt and metal particles out of the engine, thus prolonging its life. Change the
                    oil filters because the old filters contain buildup of oil and dirt particles that will
                    otherwise remain and mix with the new, clean oil.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Change Spark Plugs</h6>
                <p>Many manufacturers recommend changing spark plugs every 50,000 km. This ensures good fuel
                    mileage and high engine performance.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Inspect Your Tyres Regularly</h6>
                <p>Before a summer filled with road trips, be sure to inspect your tires. Carefully look at them,
                    checking for excessive tread wear, uneven wear and bulges in the sidewalls. These are all signs
                    that you may need a new set of tires before hitting the highway.</p>
                <p>Driving on worn tires is extremely dangerous. Not only will you experience poor handling and
                    braking, but worn tires are also prone to blowouts – putting you and your passengers in a
                    precarious position.</p>
                <p>Be sure to check the tire pressure to ensure that they aren’t under or over inflated. This will
                    help maximize gas mileage on those long trips. Also take a moment to examine your spare tire to
                    make sure it is inflated properly. If you get sidelined with a flat tire, you’ll be glad you did
                    this.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Keep the Dirt Out</h6>
                <p>Dirt, dust and other contaminants are your car’s enemy. Dirt in the engine can cause a host of
                    problems including reduced gas mileage while dirt in the heating and cooling system can
                    compromise the air quality inside your vehicle.</p>
                <p>To keep the dirt out, make sure your engine air filter and cabin air filter are clean and up to
                    the job. Do a visual inspection of both filters and if either are excessively dirty, replace it
                    with a new filter. A dirty engine air filter reduces the amount of fresh air your engine gets
                    while a clogged cabin air filter can affect the performance of the heating and air conditioning
                    and lead to musty odors inside your car.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Check Your Battery</h6>
                <p>I have had my car battery stop working. Everything seemed fine then my car just wouldn't start.
                    We all may be faced with a situation like this, where we are left stranded somewhere. It
                    wouldn't be fun if I was stranded at night with just my cell phone.</p>
                <p>To avoid this you can check your car battery. First check the cables and their connection to
                    the terminals. You can check for leakage or any mineral build up around the cables and terminals.
                    Clean the terminal with a battery cleaning brush if needed and you can always apply dielectric
                    grease to help them stay corrosion free.
                    Using a multimeter with the engine off, you can check if the battery is charged fully (about
                    12.4 to 12.7 volts). When the car is on you can carefully check the voltage. It should be around
                    13.7 to 14.7 volts.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Clean Your Windshields and Replace the Wipers</h6>
                <p>A dirty windshield can prove to be a lot of hassle when you can't see clearly. If they are not
                    cleaned regularly they can cause visual impairments and can result in accidents at times.
                    It is very important for the driver to have a clear view of the road for safe driving. If you
                    don't clean them, the dirt and particles can accumulate and scratch the windshield when you use
                    the wipers.</p>
                <p>If the rainy season is approaching, check your wipers and get them replaced if needed. Using
                    damaged wipers can cause scratches on the glass and obstruct your view, which might lead to the
                    need to replace your entire windshield.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Inspect and Replace Serpentine Belts</h6>
                <p>Thoroughly inspect your serpentine belts and check for wear. If these belts fail, they can cause
                    damage to the engine parts, making a small priced item that needs to be replaced turn into a
                    huge bill.</p>
                <p>If you get regular maintenance, your car dealer service center should let you know when it's time
                    to replace the belt. It is recommended to get it checked every 60,000 miles but you should look
                    at the owner's manual to get the best information for your car. Replacing a belt is usually easy
                    with a few tools.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Check Your Brakes</h6>
                <p>You may have seen a movie where someone can't stop their car because their brake lines were cut. In
                    real life we won't have this scene play out, but if we ignore brake problems we can find
                    ourselves getting into an accident.</p>
                <p>If the brakes fail to work properly, it can be caused by some of the following: the rotors, the
                    brake pads, the brake fluid, and the brake pedal. The most common reason would be the brake pads
                    or a leak in the brake fluid.</p>
                <p>It's a good idea to check your brakes if you notice any issues out of the ordinary. If you want
                    to check the brakes yourself, you'll need to inspect the brake pads and brake fluid reservoir.
                    This usually requires removing the tires and possibly getting under the car if you suspect a
                    brake fluid leak.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Carry Automotive Tools at All Times</h6>
                <p>A good tip to maintain your car on the go is to carry some basic tools, so you'll be ready to
                    face different problems and have tools to work with. Delaying fixing a leak, for
                    example, can potentially cause damage to your engine or other car systems.
                    Either you will need to call for a tow truck or use your tools to work on the problem. Driving
                    might not be an option.</p>
                <p>Tools that might be helpful are: thick gloves, heat-resistant waterproof silicone tape,
                    electrical tape, wire cutters, screwdrivers (Phillips head and flat head), tongue and groove
                    pliers, a flashlight, and a knife. A tool kit might come in handy.
                    A set of tools, which is readily available, will give you choices that you wouldn't have
                    otherwise. They come in handy in other situations as well. Deciding where to store them might be
                    the hardest decision you make.</p>
